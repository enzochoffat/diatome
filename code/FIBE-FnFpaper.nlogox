  <info>## WHAT IS IT?

(a general understanding of what the model is trying to show or explain)

FIBE represents a simple fishery model. Fish that reproduce and fisher with different fishing styles that fish as their main source of income. The aim of the model is to reflect the different fishing behaviours as described and observed in the (Swedish) Baltic Sea fishery and explore the consequences of different approximations of human/fisher behaviour in under different environmental and managerial scenarios.

The overarching aim is to advance the incorporation and understanding of human behaviour (diversity) in fisheries research and management. In particular focusing on insights from social (fishery) science of fisher behaviour.

## HOW IT WORKS

(what rules the agents use to create the overall behavior of the model)
Depending on the fishing style the fisher agents represent they fish differently given their motivation and fishing practise:

  * A **trawler** fisher agent only goes fishing if it expects an economic return. This means that the expected catch should at least cover the operating costs for the trawler fisher agent to decide to go out and fish. At sea, it bases its catch expectation on the fish it can perceive nearby (e.g. using sonar technology in the real-world). 

  * A **coastal** fisher agent decides to go fishing when the trade-off between expected profit and time not spent at home is not too big. This means that if a coastal fisher agent has satisfied its preference for staying home and expects a profit, it will go out fishing. Coastal fisher agents stay at home when staying home preference is not satisfied or they expect no profit. 

  * An **archipelago** fisher agent goes out fishing when it needs to, i.e. when it has not caught enough in the previous week or in the situation of having negative capital. In addition, if the archipelago fisher thinks the fish is scarce, it can decide against fishing and instead reduce living expenses. 


## HOW TO USE IT

(how to use the model, including a description of each of the items in the Interface tab)
Set the basics:

  * end-of-sim-in-years: for the duration of the simulation. _Default = 25_ (in years, a tick is a day) 
  * Number of agents:
    * archipelago-fisher: for the archipelago agents.
    * coastal-fisher: for the coastal agents.
    * offshore-trawler-fisher: for the trawler agents 

Environment settings:

  * spatial-representation: to indicates whether the fish are equally distributed or resided in er density hotspots. _Default = hotspots_
  * init-stock-size: To indicate the initial stocksize Set it to a quarter, half or full carrying capacity. _Default = half carrying capacity_.
  * repr4All: to set the reproduction rate of the fish._Default = 1_.


Fisher agent settings:

  * socialInfluence:affects the way the trawler and coastal select where to fish, based on social information. _Default = expertise_
  * home-satisf-threshold = Satisfaction threshold for the coastal agents. _Default = 0.5_
  * memory-time-length: memory over time. _Default = 365_
  * memory-spatial-length: spatial memory. _Default = 20_

Scenario settings

  * fuel-subsidy: whether (0) and height of a fuel subsity.
  * bad-weather-probability: probability that there is bad weather, this affects the archipelago and coastal agents. _Default =  0.1_


## THINGS TO NOTICE
(suggested things for the user to notice while running the model)



## THINGS TO TRY

(suggested things for the user to try to do (move sliders, switches, etc.) with the model)

## EXTENDING THE MODEL

(suggested things to add or change in the Code tab to make the model more complicated, detailed, accurate, etc.)

## NETLOGO FEATURES

(interesting or unusual features of NetLogo that the model uses, particularly in the Code tab; or where workarounds were needed for missing features)

## RELATED MODELS

(models in the NetLogo Models Library and elsewhere which are of related interest)
